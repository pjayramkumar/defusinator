<H3>History</H3>
<P> The origin of the project was my deFus.js code which created a special DOM emulation within SpiderMonkey so that I could de-obfuscate most of the malicious sample I analyze day-by-day. The certain limitation of this was the lack of full DOM implementation and the time needed to grab the targeted JavaScript from a page and push it to this system.

deFusinator was a logical follow up for that project, as Chrome browser gives a full-blown DOM implementation plus I do not need to copy+paste the script from the page source, just point and click the script and see what it does.</P>
